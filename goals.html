				Get through the first semester of my Web Development course. This is the first big hurdle to see how intense the course will get, 
				and how I’ll learn to adapt to the course expectations.

				<td class="number">2</td>
				<td class="goals">
				Build my confidence as a web developer, by making sure I not only pass my Web Development courses, but also have a broad understanding 
				of the topics being taught. This will also be achieved by answering questions during class, even if I run the risk of being incorrect (until I learn).
				</td>

			  <tr>
				<td class="number">3</td>
				<td class="goals">
				Help to mentor fellow classmates to both broaden my understanding by being able to speak to the material I’m learning, as well as,
				providing guidance to those who are newer to the idea of web programming.
				</td>

				Connect with fellow classmates and faculty at NSCC to build up a local network that will go beyond my time at NSCC.

				Successfully graduate from the  IT Web Development from NSCC.

				A change of jobs. Where my previous focus was on graphic design, I’d like to now focus my career path on programming. 
				I would still like to bring my previously learned skills to the table, which I believe will be an extra asset.
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td class="number">2</td>
				<td class="goals">
				Once I’ve graduated from NSCC, the goal is to find a career that I can not only excel at, but also brings me joy. 
				Working with a team of dedicated professionals again would be a plus, but I’m also open to more independent work as needed.
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td class="number">3</td>
				<td class="goals">
				To continue to focus on my own personal development both through work, and on my own. Going back to college was a great help 
				to continue my personal growth, and I want to keep growing even after I’ve completed my program. I want to continue to teach 
				myself new skills, as well as, refresh some graphic design skills.
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td class="number">4</td>
				<td class="goals">
				I aim to be comfortable enough with my programming skills that I can once again mentor and teach my fellow colleges. 
				I did a lot of mentoring when I was a media developer at Atlantis System Eduplus, which I really enjoyed. Mentoring not 
				only helped bring newer developers on board, but also helped to make a friendlier environment where we supported each other.
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td class="number">5</td>
				<td class="goals">
				Down the road, I’m looking to work toward taking on a leadership role. I have some experience being a team lead on smaller 
				projects as a graphic designer, and I would like to continue to develop those skills for bigger and better projects.
